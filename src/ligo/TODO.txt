# Main

## Back-end

- Replace Mini_c environments with stacks
- Think about Coq

## Amendments

- Bubble_n
- Partial application
- Type size limit (1.000 -> 10.000)

# PPX

## Deriving

- Generate ADT helpers (this removes 90% of Combinators and a lot of maintenance when modifying ASTs)
- Generate option helpers (this makes writing main much easier, much like one would in an untyped language)
